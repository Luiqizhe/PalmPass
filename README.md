# PalmPass Palm-Vein-Recognition-Exam-Management-System

Having strong examination integrity and managing attendance efficiently has become increasingly challenging in today’s modern world, especially in education-centered institutions like universities. Manual systems are prone to errors, impersonation, and inefficiency. Traditional methods such as paper-based attendance, manual bathroom logs, and weak real-time security often lead to oversight and exposure to potential misconduct during high-stakes examinations.

That is where our system, called PalmPass, comes in to address these issues by using an AI-powered, non-contact palm recognition system designed to make examination hall operations less tiring and more secure. It consists of three main functions: 
(1) Student Registration, which authenticates students’ palms while marking attendance, 
(2) Lecturer Verification of Assigned Seats, ensuring students sit in their designated seats using real-time biometric and seating data, and 
(3) Bathroom Logging and Tracking, which records students’ exits and returns with timestamps.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).
